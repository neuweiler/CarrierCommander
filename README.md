# CarrierCommander
A java based open source re-make of a once fantastic game

All you can do currently is steer the vehicles with the arrow keys and switch between them

The purpose of this re-make is to:
1) keep up the original spirit of the game
2) use state-of-the-art graphics based on OpenGL
3) make the program run on major platforms (Linux, Mac, Windows, Android) by using Java and the JMonkey3 platform

download the necessary jmonkey jars automatically - no need to install anything related
