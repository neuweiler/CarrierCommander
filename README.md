# CarrierCommander
A java based open source re-make of a once fantastic game

The game is currently not playable !!

The purpose of this re-make is to:
1) keep up the original spirit of the game
2) use state-of-the-art graphics based on OpenGL
3) make the program run on major platforms (Linux, Mac, Windows, Android) by using Java and the JMonkey3 platform

Note: This is a JMonkeyPlatform project (based on Netbeans) and also an Eclipse project. If you would like to import it
      into Eclipse, make sure to create another project manually named jME3, unzip the latest distribution file of jMonkey 
      (http://updates.jmonkeyengine.org/stable/3.0/engine) add all files in lib to the build path and export them all,
      so they're visible for other projects.
